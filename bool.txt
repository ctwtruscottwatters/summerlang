a program is a sequence of definitions and commands definitions evaluated
command executed by Python interpreter

commands (statements) instruct interpreter to do something

can be typed directly in a shell or stored in a file 

OBJECTS

programs manipulate  data objects


objects have a type that defines the kind of things the program can do to them

objects are: scalar or not scalar

scalar - can't be subdivided

non-scalar 

int - represents integers
float - represents real numbers
bool - represent Boolean values True and False
NoneType - special, and has one value, None
can use type() to see the value of an object

3:57

equal sign is an assignment

pi = 3.14159

pi_approx = 22/7

value stored in computer memory

an assignment binds name to value

retrieve value by name

pi

// integer division

give names

reuse names

# comment

+= 1 

assignment plus increment

re bind


i and j are any variable names

i > j

i >= j

i < j

i <= j

i == j equality

i != j inequality

logic operators on booleans

not a  

a and b True if both are True

a or b False if Both are False, True if any are true or both are true

branching programs

the simplest branching is a conditional

A test (True or False)

A block of code to execute if the test is true
an optional block for if the test is false

x = int(input('Enter an integer: '))

if x % 2 == 0:
	print('')
	print('Even')
else:
	print('')
	print('Odd')
print('Done with conditional')

x % 2 evaluates to true

== is used for comparison, = is assignment

the indentation is important

if x % 2 == 0:
	if x % 3 == 0:
		print('Divisible by 2 and 3')
	print('is divisible by 2')
elif x % 3 == 0:
	print('is divisible by 3')

if x < y and x < z:
	print('x is the least')
elif x < y:
	print('x is smaller')
else:
	print('y is smaller')

if <condition> :
if <condition>:
else:

if <condition>

elif <condition>

else <condition>

x = float(input("Enter a number for x: "))
y = float(input("Enter a number for y: "))
if x == y:
	print("x and y are equal")
	if y != 0:
		print("therefore, x / y is", x / y)
elif x < y:
	print("x is smaller")
else:
	print("y is smaller")

print("thanks!")

Strings, Branching and Iteration

BRANCHING

decisions, algorithms

variable names

- descriptive
-meaningful
-helps you read code
-cannot be keywords

value

-information stored
-can be updated

variable binding

right hand side = value
left hand side = variable

x = 2 // 2
x = x * x // 4
y = x + 1 // y = 5

int

float

bool

string

letters, special characters, spaces, sequences of characters, spaces, digits

enclose in double or single quotes

concatenate

overloaded operators

type of an object tells an operation important information

concatenation +
successive concatenation *
len('charles') the length
'eric'[1] // r
begins with index 0 attempting to index beyond -1 is error
'eric'[1:3] slicing // ri
